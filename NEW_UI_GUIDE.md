## 🐛 Notes

### Token/NFT Lists
Currently, the token and NFT lists require known contract addresses. For a production app, you'd want to:
- Use a blockchain indexer (like The Graph)
- Implement token discovery via events
- Use a service like Alchemy/Moralis for automatic detection

### Transaction History
The current implementation is simplified. For production:
- Use Monad Explorer API
- Implement proper indexing
- Show more transaction details

### Performance
- All lists have auto-refresh
- Can be optimized with manual refresh buttons
- Consider pagination for large lists

## 🎉 Summary

You now have a beautiful, functional wallet interface that:
- ✅ Looks professional and modern
- ✅ Has all core wallet features
- ✅ Auto-refreshes data
- ✅ Supports tokens and NFTs
- ✅ Shows transaction history
- ✅ Mobile-optimized
- ✅ Easy to extend

Enjoy your new MONSEND wallet! 🚀
